## Overview

Metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) is an important tool for characterizing viruses in clinical samples. It is culture-independent, requires no a priori knowledge of the viruses in the sample, and may provide extensive genomic information. However, MSS can be less sensitive than targeted molecular tests and may not yield sufficient sequence data for detailed analysis. We designed a sequence capture reagent, **ViroCap**, which targets viruses from 38 families that can infect vertebrate or invertebrate hosts. An innovative computational approach condensed 1 billion nucleotides of sequence into 200 million bases of unique target sequence suitable for production with Roche NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Developer Library. We tested **ViroCap** on samples containing 19 genera from 10 families, and **ViroCap** correlated perfectly with molecular assays for virus detection. Depth- and breadth-of-coverage of the genomes were consistently improved, and the percentage of viral sequences in each sequence data set increased 10- to 11,000- fold post-capture. This approach will significantly improve MSS studies while reducing the cost of sequencing.
